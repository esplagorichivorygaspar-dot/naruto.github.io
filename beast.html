        jinchurikiOrigin: "Like other Iwagakure jinchuriki, Kokuo was sealed into hosts primarily for military purposes. The village's rocky terrain and hot springs made it an ideal environment for steam-based techniques, leading to specialized training methods for Five-Tails jinchuriki.",

It has the ability to split into smaller slugs and can stick to surfaces, making it incredibly versatile in combat.",
        jinchurikiOrigin: "Kirigakure's method of creating jinchuriki was often brutal and experimental. The village's focus on bloodline abilities and kekkei genkai made them interested in Saiken's unique corrosive powers, leading to painful sealing procedures and harsh training regimens.",
