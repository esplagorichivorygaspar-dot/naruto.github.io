      <p><strong>Short Story:</strong> Amidst the snowy mists of Kirigakure, a lone shinobi raised his hands, and water froze mid-air, forming deadly mirrors of ice. His reflection multiplied, and blades of frost shot forth — an elegant yet deadly dance of frozen death.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Yuki Clan of Kirigakure possessed the kekkei genkai of Ice Release, combining water and wind chakra to create powerful frozen techniques. Feared for their abilities, the clan was persecuted during times of bloodline purges, leading to near extinction. Haku, one of its last known descendants, carried on the clan’s legacy with mastery over crystal-clear ice mirrors and lethal precision.</p>
