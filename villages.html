Throughout history, Konohagakure has been central to all major conflicts, from the Warring States period through the Fourth Great Ninja War, always fighting to protect peace and uphold the Will of Fire philosophy.</p>

Due to internal strife, the village remained isolated during most major conflicts but eventually joined the Allied Shinobi Forces in the Fourth Great Ninja War after overcoming the Bloody Mist period.</p>

The village has been home to powerful shinobi including A (Third & Fourth Raikage), Killer B (Eight-Tails Jinchūriki), Darui (Fifth Raikage), C, and many skilled lightning users.

            The village produced notable figures including Akahoshi, Sumaru, Hokuto, and various star-trained ninja who 
            could manipulate peacock-like chakra constructs. Despite the star's power allowing rapid advancement in abilities,
